# SnapMemories
Snapchat is now charging for memories storage space. There's tons of pictures up there, but downloading them manually is a pain. There are some other solutions out there but they don't really seem to do exactly what I want.


# Roadmap

- [ ] Parse json
- [ ] Create dataframe with relevant metadata
- [ ] Split dataframe into chunks
- [ ] Process each chunk:
