# SnapMemories
Snapchat is now charging for memories storage space. There's tons of pictures up there, but downloading them manually is a pain. There are some other solutions out there but they don't really seem to do exactly what I want.


# Roadmap
- [x] Parse html
- [ ] Parse json
- [x] Create dataframe with relevant metadata
- [x] Split dataframe into chunks
- [ ] Process each chunk:
- [ ] Download image
- [ ] Change metadata
- [ ] Change name
